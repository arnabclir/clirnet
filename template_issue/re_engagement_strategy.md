# Re-Engagement Strategy for CLIRNET

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive multi-channel re-engagement strategy to win back inactive doctors across four key scenarios using WhatsApp, SMS, and Email with optimal timing sequences and urgency-driven messaging.

## Target User Segments

1. **AiDA Users (No Agent Usage)** - Doctors who used AiDA but haven't explored AI agents
2. **Incomplete Course Users** - Doctors with started but unfinished courses
3. **No-Show Registrants** - Doctors who registered for sessions but didn't attend and haven't viewed recordings
4. **Certificate Non-Claimers** - Doctors who earned certificates but haven't downloaded/viewed them

---

## Key Principles

### Multi-Channel Strategy
- **WhatsApp**: 98% open rate, best for urgent/time-sensitive messages
- **SMS**: 98% open rate, professional and direct
- **Email**: 21% open rate, best for detailed content and educational material
- **Timing**: 3-5 days between messages, start after 30-60 days of inactivity

### Messaging Framework
1. **Personalization**: Use doctor's name, reference specific content/courses
2. **Value-First**: Lead with benefits, not features
3. **Urgency Hooks**: Time-limited offers, scarcity, social proof
4. **Clear CTA**: Single, unambiguous action per message
5. **Professional Tone**: No emojis unless strategically placed, respectful language

### FOMO & Urgency Techniques (Ethically Applied)
- Limited-time access windows
- Exclusive content availability
- Peer achievement statistics
- Progress acknowledgment
- Opportunity cost framing

---

```
Dear Dr. {{first_name}} {{last_name}},

We've noticed you've been using AiDA to enhance your medical practice. That's excellent, and we're glad it's been helpful.

However, you may not be aware that CLIRNET now offers something even more powerful: specialized AI Agents designed specifically for clinical decision support.

**What makes AI Agents different from AiDA?**

AiDA provides general medical information and insights, while AI Agents offer:

• Specialty-specific diagnostic support (Cardiology, Oncology, Pediatrics, etc.)
• Differential diagnosis generation based on presenting symptoms
• Evidence-based treatment protocol recommendations
• Patient care plan templates
• Complex case analysis with literature references

**Your exclusive trial invitation**

Based on your engagement with AiDA, we're offering you complimentary access to AI Agents for the next 14 days.

[Start Your Free Trial →] {{shortlink}}

**What doctors are saying:**

"I used the Cardiology AI Agent for a patient with atypical chest pain. It suggested a diagnosis I hadn't considered, which turned out to be correct." 
— Dr. Rajesh Sharma, Cardiologist, Mumbai

"The AI Agent saved me 45 minutes of research on a complex pediatric case."
— Dr. Priya Menon, Pediatrician, Bangalore

This trial access is available only until {{expiry_date}}.

Best regards,
Team CLIRNET

P.S. Your AiDA history will automatically sync with AI Agents, so you can pick up right where you left off.
```

**Email 2 (Day 3) - Case Study**

Subject: How Dr. Kumar solved a complex case in 10 minutes

```
Dear Dr. {{first_name}},

Three days ago, we invited you to try CLIRNET's AI Agents. We wanted to share a quick story that might resonate with you.

**A Real Case Study:**

Dr. Amit Kumar, a general physician in Delhi, had a patient with:
- Intermittent fever (3 weeks)
- Joint pain
- Unexplained rash
- Normal routine blood work

He spent 20 minutes with our Rheumatology AI Agent, which:
1. Generated a differential diagnosis list (8 possibilities)
2. Suggested specific tests to rule in/out each condition
3. Provided current treatment guidelines for the top 3 probabilities

Result: Patient was diagnosed with Adult-onset Still's Disease within 48 hours.

**Your trial status:** 11 days remaining

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Campaign-Level Metrics
- **Enrollment Rate**: % of eligible users enrolled in campaigns
- **Message Delivery Rate**: % of messages successfully delivered
- **Open Rate**: % of messages opened (WhatsApp/Email)
- **Click-Through Rate**: % of users who clicked CTAs
- **Conversion Rate**: % of users who completed target action
- **Unsubscribe Rate**: % of users who opted out
- **ROI**: Reactivated users × average user value / campaign cost

### Segment-Specific Goals
1. **AiDA → Agents**: 20% adoption rate within 14 days
2. **Incomplete Courses**: 35% completion rate within 21 days
3. **No-Show Registrants**: 40% recording view rate within 10 days
4. **Unclaimed Certificates**: 60% download rate within 14 days

### Channel Performance
- **WhatsApp**: Target 80%+ open rate, 25%+ click rate
- **SMS**: Target 75%+ open rate, 15%+ click rate
- **Email**: Target 30%+ open rate, 8%+ click rate

---

## Testing & Optimization

### A/B Testing Framework
1. **Subject Lines** (Email): Test 2-3 variations per campaign
2. **CTA Wording**: Test urgency vs. value-driven CTAs
3. **Timing**: Test different send times (morning vs. evening)
4. **Message Length**: Test short vs. detailed messages
5. **Personalization Level**: Test basic vs. advanced personalization

### Optimization Cycle
1. **Week 1-2**: Launch with default templates
2. **Week 3**: Analyze performance, identify underperformers
3. **Week 4**: Implement A/B tests on lowest performers
4. **Week 5**: Roll out winning variations
5. **Week 6+**: Continuous optimization based on data

---

## Compliance & Best Practices

### Legal Requirements
- **Opt-out mechanism**: Include unsubscribe option in every message
- **Data privacy**: Comply with medical data regulations (HIPAA-equivalent)
- **Consent tracking**: Maintain records of communication preferences
- **Rate limiting**: Respect provider limits and best practices

### Message Frequency Caps
- **Maximum per day**: 2 messages across all channels
- **Maximum per week**: 5 messages across all channels
- **Minimum interval**: 24 hours between messages in same channel

### Unsubscribe Handling
- Honor unsubscribe requests within 24 hours
- Provide granular control (by channel, by campaign type)
- Never re-enroll unsubscribed users automatically

---

## Success Metrics & Timeline

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1-2)
- Database schema implementation
- Celery task development
- Integration with messaging providers
- Template loading and testing

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Week 3-4)
- Launch with 10% of eligible users
- Monitor delivery rates and errors
- Gather initial performance data
- Fix any technical issues

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 5-6)
- Scale to 100% of eligible users
- Implement A/B testing framework
- Begin optimization cycle

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 7+)
- Weekly performance reviews
- Continuous template improvements
- Expand to additional segments
- Introduce advanced personalization
