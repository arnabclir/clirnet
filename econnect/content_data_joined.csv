46013,8611,CKD Screening in Type 2 DM,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) screening in individuals with type 2 diabetes is essential to prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of CKD, yet a significant proportion remain undiagnosed. Early detection is critical, as it allows for timely intervention to slow disease progression.[1] Screening typically involves measuring urinary albumin excretion (UAE), which helps identify early signs of kidney damage. Regular monitoring of UAE and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can aid in the early identification of CKD.[2] Screening should begin at diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes and continue annually, as early intervention with lifestyle changes and pharmacologic treatments, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, can significantly reduce the risk of ESRD and improve long-term outcomes.Reference(s):1. https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02438-62. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56765-0",229,75,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0"
46014,8612,Medical Management of Renal Stones,"Kidney stones affect 1 in 11 people globally, with a high recurrence rate within 5–10 years.[1] In India, about 2 million cases of urolithiasis are reported annually. Most stones are calcium-based (70–80%), followed by uric acid, cystine, struvite, and mixed types. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, metabolic syndrome, low fluid intake, and high intake of sodium, animal protein, and oxalate-rich foods. Common symptoms include renal colic, flank pain, hematuria, and urinary tract infections (UTIs).[2] Diagnostic evaluation involves KUB X-ray, ultrasound, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), or helical CT, which has a sensitivity of 97%.[1] Management includes increased fluid intake, adequate dietary calcium (1000–1200 mg/day) in recurrent calcium stone formers, and reduction of sodium and oxalate intake, along with correction of hypocitraturia.[1][3] Pharmacological options—based on stone type—include thiazides, Potassium citrate, Allopurinol, Pyridoxine, and Tiopronin.[3] Medical expulsive therapy with Tamsulosin, Nifedipine, and steroids helps facilitate ureteric stone passage.[1]Reference(s):1. https://journals.lww.com/indjem/fulltext/2012/16020/medical_management_of_renal_stone.14.aspx2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817324/3. https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i52.full",217,79,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0"

46062,8624,Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease,"Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD).[1] Anemia refers to a decrease in the number of RBCs or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. It is relatively uncommon in stages 1-2 of CKD; however, almost 90% of patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 mL/min are anemic. Also, the prevalence of anemia in CKD increases as the CKD stage increases. For the evaluation of anemia in CKD, the initial tests must include a variety of tests, including complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin, serum transferrin saturation (TSAT), absolute reticulocyte count, serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Iron therapy is a commonly adopted approach for the treatment of anemia in CKD.[2]Reference(s):1. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11200696/2. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7863960/",164,63,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0"
46067,8629,Cardiorenal Syndrome,"Cardiorenal syndrome refers to the interdependent dysfunction of the heart and kidneys, where acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ induces dysfunction in the other. The pathophysiology is complex, involving the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), nitric oxide-reactive oxygen species (NO-ROS) imbalance, inflammation, and sympathetic activation.[1] Five types of cardiorenal syndrome are recognized, each defined by the primary organ dysfunction, with a novel sixth type, chronic secondary cardiorenal syndrome, also proposed. Patient history, clinical examination, and management aid in understanding the condition, while specific biomarkers for the heart and kidneys play a crucial role in diagnosis. Ultrasound is preferred for imaging, although MRI and nuclear imaging are also utilized. Key management strategies include decongestive therapies, ionotropic therapy, and RAAS inhibition, with specific treatment algorithms suggested by the cardio-renal dysfunction study group.[2]Reference(s):1. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9179008/2. https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063 ",328,103,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0"

Escherichia coli remains the most common pathogen, though others like Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus are also implicated in the infection. Clinical diagnosis relies on pyuria, bacteriuria, and the presence of symptoms; however, urine tests can be misleading, especially in oliguria or anuria. Treatment follows standard UTI guidelines, but antibiotics must be adjusted for the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and dialysis clearance to avoid toxicity. Nephrotoxic agents (aminoglycosides, polymyxins) are used cautiously; Nitrofurantoin and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole are often avoided due to low urinary excretion and accumulation risk.1Reference(s):1. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8777485/",432,184,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0"

Renal function tests, including serum creatinine, plasma urea, urine volume, and minerals in urine, monitor renal damage and help determine the underlying etiology. The ideal GFR marker, such as inulin, is metabolically inert and cleared only by the kidneys.[2]&nbsp;Other markers like creatinine and urea are also used, though each has limitations. While creatinine clearance is useful, it can be inaccurate at low GFR and affected by drugs. Advanced methods, including radiolabeled compounds, can further assess kidney function.Reference(s):1.&nbsp;https://www.annlabmed.org/journal/view.html?uid=3514&amp;vmd=Full2.&nbsp;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11150208/",674,205,"0,0,0,0,0,0,0"

49493,10399,Proteinuria in Chronic Kidney Disease,"Proteinuria, the presence of excess protein in urine, is a significant marker of kidney damage in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It results from glomerular injury, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier, allowing proteins like albumin to pass into the urine.[1]&nbsp;Proteinuria is both a sign of kidney dysfunction and a risk factor for disease progression. The amount of proteinuria correlates with the severity of kidney damage and can predict the progression to end-stage renal disease. Managing proteinuria involves controlling blood pressure, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which help reduce protein leakage.[2]&nbsp;Tight glycemic control in diabetic patients and lifestyle modifications are also crucial. Regular monitoring of protein levels is essential for assessing CKD progression and treatment effectiveness.Reference(s):1.&nbsp;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64833-82.&nbsp;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9380095/",791,39,"0,0,2,1,1,1,1"

It has been substantiated that approximately 1 in 10 individuals are affected by CKD. Anemia is a common complication in CKD, and is associated with a reduced quality of life, and an increased morbidity and mortality.[1]&nbsp;In CKD, anemia develops when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases to &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. With CKD disease progression, the prevalence of anemia increases. Common symptoms of anemia in CKD include dyspnea, fatigue, generalized weakness, headache, decreased concentration, dizziness, and reduced exercise tolerance. Moreover, up to 60% of patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD develop anemia and around 50% of patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD have iron deficiency.Reference(s):1.&nbsp;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8032930/",1682,28,"0,0,0,0,0,0,2"

44780,35225,Detection and evaluation of CKD,"Detection and evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) primarily involves assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is now widely estimated based on serum creatinine levels.[1] Estimated GFR helps assess renal function, severity of disease, appropriate drug dosing, and renal involvement in systemic diseases. Renal function tests, including serum creatinine, plasma urea, urine volume, and minerals in urine, monitor renal damage and help determine the underlying etiology. The ideal GFR marker, such as inulin, is metabolically inert and cleared only by the kidneys.[2] Other markers like creatinine and urea are also used, though each has limitations. While creatinine clearance is useful, it can be inaccurate at low GFR and affected by drugs. Advanced methods, including radiolabeled compounds, can further assess kidney function.

Measured GFR (mGFR) using exogenous markers, like urinary or plasma clearance of filtration substances, is the gold standard but is not routinely used due to its complexity. Renal function tests typically rely on estimated GFR (eGFR) using serum creatinine or creatinine clearance (Clcr), which, despite limitations, remains the most common method.[1] Emerging markers like cystatin C offer potential for improved accuracy and may become routine in the future. The KDIGO classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) categorizes CKD into stages based on eGFR values, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.[2] While exogenous substances provide precise measurements, endogenous markers are being explored for better clinical integration.

Diabetic patients are at an increased risk of CKD, yet a significant proportion remain undiagnosed. Early detection is critical, as it allows for timely intervention to slow disease progression.[1] Screening typically involves measuring urinary albumin excretion (UAE), which helps identify early signs of kidney damage. Regular monitoring of UAE and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can aid in the early identification of CKD.[2] Screening should begin at diagnosis in Type 2 diabetes and continue annually, as early intervention with lifestyle changes and pharmacologic treatments, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, can significantly reduce the risk of ESRD and improve long-term outcomes.

45049,35410,Proteinuria in chronic kidney disease,"Proteinuria, the presence of excess protein in urine, is a significant marker of kidney damage in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It results from glomerular injury, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier, allowing proteins like albumin to pass into the urine.[1] Proteinuria is both a sign of kidney dysfunction and a risk factor for disease progression. The amount of proteinuria correlates with the severity of kidney damage and can predict the progression to end-stage renal disease. Managing proteinuria involves controlling blood pressure, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which help reduce protein leakage.[2] Tight glycemic control in diabetic patients and lifestyle modifications are also crucial. Regular monitoring of protein levels is essential for assessing CKD progression and treatment effectiveness.

Bone mineral disorders associated with CKD are characterized by systemic disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism.[1] These disorders are manifested through abnormalities in calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), or vitamin D metabolism. Furthermore, disruptions in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength are commonly observed. Vascular or soft tissue calcification may also be present. The pathophysiology of these bone mineral disorders is linked to the impaired kidney function in CKD, which alters the regulation of key minerals and hormones, leading to significant skeletal and vascular complications.[2] Management typically involves addressing the underlying metabolic abnormalities to mitigate the progression of these disorders.

The pathophysiology is complex, involving the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), nitric oxide-reactive oxygen species (NO-ROS) imbalance, inflammation, and sympathetic activation.[1] Five types of cardiorenal syndrome are recognized, each defined by the primary organ dysfunction, with a novel sixth type, chronic secondary cardiorenal syndrome, also proposed. Patient history, clinical examination, and management aid in understanding the condition, while specific biomarkers for the heart and kidneys play a crucial role in diagnosis. Ultrasound is preferred for imaging, although MRI and nuclear imaging are also utilized. Key management strategies include decongestive therapies, ionotropic therapy, and RAAS inhibition, with specific treatment algorithms suggested by the cardio-renal dysfunction study group.[2]

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is widely accepted as the best index of kidney function in health and disease, and accurate values are required for optimal decision-making. Estimated GFR has been included in clinical practice guidelines to enable physicians to identify patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to enable earlier interventions to slow the progression of the disease.[1] Measured GFR using urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous filtration markers is considered the gold standard for evaluation of kidney function but is not routinely available. Inulin, creatinine, and urea are candidate markers of GFR. Additionally, a number of radiolabelled chelates have been used to assess GFR. It is recommended that CKD be classified based on the GFR category and the albuminuria category.[2]

It is relatively uncommon in stages 1-2 of CKD; however, almost 90% of patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 mL/min are anemic. Also, the prevalence of anemia in CKD increases as the CKD stage increases. For the evaluation of anemia in CKD, the initial tests must include a variety of tests, including complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin, serum transferrin saturation (TSAT), absolute reticulocyte count, serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Iron therapy is a commonly adopted approach for the treatment of anemia in CKD.[2]

45701,35694,Proteinuria in chronic kidney disease,"Proteinuria, the presence of excess protein in urine, is a significant marker of kidney damage in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It results from glomerular injury, leading to increased permeability of the filtration barrier, allowing proteins like albumin to pass into the urine.[1] Proteinuria is both a sign of kidney dysfunction and a risk factor for disease progression. The amount of proteinuria correlates with the severity of kidney damage and can predict the progression to end-stage renal disease. Managing proteinuria involves controlling blood pressure, particularly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which help reduce protein leakage.[2] Tight glycemic control in diabetic patients and lifestyle modifications are also crucial. Regular monitoring of protein levels is essential for assessing CKD progression and treatment effectiveness.

45703,35695,Nutritional management of chronic kidney disease and dialysis,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health issue affecting approximately 5%&ndash;15% of the population, with a growing number progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.[1] Nutritional management plays a critical role across all stages of CKD. Early intervention targets modifiable risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension through dietary adjustments, including reduced salt intake, increased fruits and vegetables, and lower saturated fat consumption. As eGFR declines, patients may develop dyslipidemia, anemia, and acidosis, requiring reduced animal protein intake, increased consumption of unsaturated fats and whole grains, and careful fluid management. In advanced stages of kidney failure, malnutrition, inflammation, and mineral-bone disorder become major concerns. Nutritional strategies include limiting fluid intake and dietary phosphate, optimizing protein quality and quantity, and introducing oral nutrition supplements when intake or weight declines. Tailored dietary approaches, along with regular monitoring, are essential to slow CKD progression and improve patient outcomes.[2]

45788,35720,Conventional and novel therapies for treating iron deficiency anemia in ND-CKD,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common complication in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients, often exacerbated by inflammation and impaired iron utilization. Treatment strategies involve identifying absolute vs. functional iron deficiency using indicators like TSAT and ferritin levels.[1] Conventional therapies include oral iron supplements and intravenous (IV) iron, but these come with risks such as iron overload and oxidative stress. Novel therapies include Ferric citrate (FC), which regulates iron absorption and is FDA-approved for ND-CKD patients, Ferric maltol for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and Ferric pyrophosphate citrate (FPC), which is delivered via dialysate for hemodialysis patients. Liposomal and Sucrosomial iron offer promising results by bypassing the gastrointestinal tract, reducing side effects, and improving hemoglobin levels.[2] These emerging therapies provide safer, more effective alternatives for managing IDA in CKD.

Primary causes include minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and hereditary nephropathies, while secondary causes include diabetes mellitus, lupus, vasculitis, and infections such as hepatitis B and HIV. In children, minimal change disease is the most frequent cause. Edema is the hallmark clinical feature of NS. Initial treatment typically involves corticosteroids, with a 12-week Prednisone regimen: 60 mg/m&sup2;/day for 4 weeks, then 40 mg/m&sup2; on alternate days for another 4 weeks, followed by a taper of 5&ndash;10 mg/m&sup2; per week over 4 weeks. Thorough clinical assessment, including height, weight, blood pressure, and infection screening, is essential before initiating therapy. Patient education and adherence are critical for managing this chronic condition and preventing complications, particularly in outpatient settings where pharmacists can play a key role in supporting compliance.[1]

Nephrotic syndrome may also give rise to complications, such as infections, hypocalcemia, bone abnormalities, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypercoagulability, and hypovolemia. For diagnosis, blood tests, including serum albumin, total cholesterol and triglycerides, and creatinine assessment, are warranted. Testing for secondary causes is also recommended. Imaging tests include ultrasonography, renal biopsy tests, and autoantibodies against PLAR.[2] Management involves edema control via fluid and dietary restriction coupled with loop diuretics. Hospital admission may be needed for unresponsive patients.

45857,35747,Anemia in chronic kidney disease,"Anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD).[1] Anemia refers to a decrease in the number of RBCs or the amount of hemoglobin in the blood. It is relatively uncommon in stages 1-2 of CKD; however, almost 90% of patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 mL/min are anemic. Also, the prevalence of anemia in CKD increases as the CKD stage increases. For the evaluation of anemia in CKD, the initial tests must include a variety of tests, including complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin, serum transferrin saturation (TSAT), absolute reticulocyte count, serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Iron therapy is a commonly adopted approach for the treatment of anemia in CKD.[2]

45882,35758,Detection and evaluation of CKD,"Detection and evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) primarily involves assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is now widely estimated based on serum creatinine levels.[1] Estimated GFR helps assess renal function, severity of disease, appropriate drug dosing, and renal involvement in systemic diseases. Renal function tests, including serum creatinine, plasma urea, urine volume, and minerals in urine, monitor renal damage and help determine the underlying etiology. The ideal GFR marker, such as inulin, is metabolically inert and cleared only by the kidneys.[2] Other markers like creatinine and urea are also used, though each has limitations. While creatinine clearance is useful, it can be inaccurate at low GFR and affected by drugs. Advanced methods, including radiolabeled compounds, can further assess kidney function.

45883,35759,CKD and bone mineral disorders,"Chronic kidney disease&ndash;mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a systemic complication affecting 5&ndash;10% of the global population with CKD. It involves abnormalities in calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D metabolism, as well as disruptions in bone turnover, mineralization, and vascular or soft tissue calcification.[1],[2] CKD-MBD is often asymptomatic in its early stages, with later manifestations including joint pain, tendon rupture, fractures, and proximal muscle weakness. Both low- and high-turnover bone abnormalities may present with similar clinical features. Diagnosis typically relies on measuring calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels, with bone biopsy considered the gold standard&mdash;though its use is limited due to its invasive nature.[3] Management primarily aims to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism. KDIGO guidelines emphasize monitoring serial biochemical markers and highlight the importance of preventing hyperphosphatemia rather than focusing solely on normalization of phosphate levels.

45891,35763,Challenges and best practices for managing anemia in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease,"In recent years, chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a non-communicable disease. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the last stage of CKD. However, only 10% of patients with ESRD receive any form of renal replacement therapy (RRT).[1] Moreover, patients with moderate-to-severe cases of CKD usually develop anemia; it is commonly experienced by patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.[2] In CKD, anemia is often associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Guidelines recommend the initiation of iron agents in anemic patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD to either reduce erythropoiesis-stimulating agent doses or obtain and increase in hemoglobin levels with either oral or intravenous iron therapy for patients with transferrin saturation &le; 30% and ferritin &le; 500 &micro;g/L.
