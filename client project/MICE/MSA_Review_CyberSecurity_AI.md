# MSA Review: Cyber Security & AI Sections

**Document:** Master Services Agreement Clirnet 27th Nov 2025
**Review Date:** December 3, 2025
**Sections Reviewed:** Cyber Security Schedule (Pages 18-21), Artificial Intelligence (Pages 30-33)

---

## CYBER SECURITY SCHEDULE (Pages 18-21)

### Section 3.1 - Comprehensive Security Program (CSP)
**FLAG: HIGH PRIORITY**

| Issue | Concern for CLIRNET |
|-------|---------------------|
| Requires compliance with ISO 27001, COBIT, NIST 800-53 | **Verify if CLIRNET currently holds these certifications**. If not, this creates immediate compliance risk. |
| Annual review and updating of CSP documentation required | Ongoing operational burden |

### Section 3.2 - Subcontractor Liability
**FLAG: HIGH RISK**

> "Counterparty will remain liable and responsible for the action, inactions and performance of all obligations performed by any Subcontractor"

- CLIRNET is **fully liable for ANY subcontractor** (including cloud providers like AWS/Azure)
- Need to ensure subcontractor contracts have equivalent security terms

### Section 6.4 - Access Credentials
**FLAG: OPERATIONAL**

Requirements:
- Multifactor authentication mandatory
- Unique credentials per personnel
- **Immediate revocation** when personnel leave or change roles

**Issue:** Ensure CLIRNET has automated systems to meet immediate revocation requirement

### Section 7.2 - Patching Timelines
**FLAG: TIGHT DEADLINES**

| Severity | Required Timeline |
|----------|-------------------|
| Critical/High | **30 days** |
| Others | **90 days** |

**Issue:** These are aggressive timelines. Verify if current patching processes can meet these deadlines consistently.

### Section 8.4 - Cryptography
**FLAG: TECHNICAL**

- Requires "Strong Encryption" for all GSK Content in transit, at rest, on mobile devices, and laptops
- **Issue:** Term "Strong Encryption" is not defined - consider requesting clarification on minimum standards (e.g., AES-256)

### Section 8.6 - Security Breach Notification
**FLAG: CRITICAL - 24 HOUR DEADLINE**

> "report to GSK by email to cstd@gsk.com... within **24 hours** of Counterparty's verification"

**Issues:**
1. Very short window - need 24/7 incident response capability
2. Must include root cause analysis, remediation plans
3. Must share information shared with other customers

### Section 9.1 - GSK Audit Rights
**FLAG: BROAD SCOPE**

- GSK can audit with **minimal/no notice** for:
  - Security breaches (past 90 days)
  - Regulator inspections
  - Suspected non-compliance
- CLIRNET bears cooperation costs

---

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (Pages 30-33)

### Section 1.1 - AI Systems Notice Requirement
**FLAG: CRITICAL FOR MiCE PLATFORM**

> "Counterparty will **not use or include any AI System** in the Services and/or Deliverables unless Counterparty has provided notice to GSK and GSK has **provided written agreement**"

**Issue:** Since MiCE is described as "AI-assisted" platform, **this requires explicit written approval from GSK before the pilot begins**. Ensure this consent is documented in the SOW.

### Section 1.2 - AI Modification Restrictions
**FLAG: OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINT**

> "Counterparty will not modify any AI System that operates within the GSK environment... without providing prior written notice"
> "GSK may... instruct Counterparty to stop using the AI System... **GSK will have no liability**"

**Issues:**
1. Cannot improve/update AI models without notice
2. GSK can revoke AI authorization **at any time, with no liability**
3. This could halt the entire MiCE platform mid-project

### Section 2.1 - GSK Owns ALL AI Outputs
**FLAG: IP OWNERSHIP - CRITICAL**

> "GSK will **own all right, title and interest** to GSK AI Data, including any modifications, enhancements or derivatives"
> "Counterparty hereby **irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys**... all right, title, and interest"

**Issue:** Any content generated by MiCE using GSK data becomes GSK's property - this is standard but verify this aligns with CLIRNET's expectations.

### Section 2.2 - Use of GSK AI Data
**FLAG: SEVERE LIMITATION**

> "Counterparty will **not** use GSK AI Data to **train any AI Systems**... or to improve the operation of its services or models offered or provided to **any entity other than GSK**"

**Critical Issues:**
- Cannot use any GSK data/content to improve MiCE for other clients
- Cannot use learnings from GSK project to enhance CLIRNET's general AI capabilities
- This significantly limits the value CLIRNET can derive from this engagement beyond direct payment

### Section 3.2 - Training Data Compliance Warranties
**FLAG: LEGAL RISK**

Represents and warrants training data was NOT collected:
- By circumventing security protocols (e.g., robots.txt)
- In violation of click-through agreements
- Through theft or misappropriation
- Does not include personal information without lawful basis

**Issue:** CLIRNET must verify and **document** all data sources used to train MiCE AI components. This creates significant liability exposure.

### Section 3.3 - Training Data Selection Warranties
**FLAG: BIAS RISK**

Must warrant training data is:
- Free from **unfair bias**
- Representative of population where AI will be used
- Complete and free of errors

**Issue:** Requires ongoing bias monitoring and documentation - ensure processes exist.

### Section 5.4 - AI Discrimination
**FLAG: COMPLIANCE**

> "Counterparty will ensure... the AI System includes **reasonable controls to prevent, detect and mitigate AI Discrimination**"
> "Counterparty will notify GSK **in writing immediately** upon discovery"

**Issue:** Need documented bias testing and fairness monitoring procedures.

### Section 5.5 - AI Incident Notification
**FLAG: 48-HOUR DEADLINE**

> "report to GSK any actual or suspected AI Incident **without delay, and in any event within 48 hours**"

AI Incident includes:
- Physical harm
- Service disruption
- Deliverable inaccuracies
- Breach of law
- Property/environmental damage
- Unauthorized access to GSK AI Data

**Issue:** 48-hour reporting window requires robust incident monitoring.

### Section 5.6 - Compliance Notification
**FLAG: IMMEDIATE REPORTING**

> "provide GSK with written notice as soon as possible, but in any event **no later than 24 hours** after becoming aware of such noncompliance"

## SUMMARY: KEY ACTION ITEMS BEFORE FINALIZING

| Priority | Item | Section |
|----------|------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Obtain **written AI approval** from GSK before pilot | AI 1.1 |
| CRITICAL | Document all AI training data sources | AI 3.2-3.3 |
| CRITICAL | Accept that GSK AI data cannot be used to improve MiCE for other clients | AI 2.2 |
| HIGH | Verify ISO 27001/NIST compliance capability | Cyber 3.1 |
| HIGH | Ensure 24-hour breach notification process exists | Cyber 8.6 |
| HIGH | Confirm 30-day critical patch capability | Cyber 7.2 |
| MEDIUM | Establish AI bias monitoring procedures | AI 5.4 |
| MEDIUM | Define "Strong Encryption" standards | Cyber 8.4 |

## NEGOTIATION POINTS TO CONSIDER

1. **AI 2.2 - Data Use Restriction**: This is very restrictive. Consider negotiating for anonymized/aggregated learnings exception.

2. **AI 1.2 - Revocation without liability**: Consider requesting a minimum notice period before GSK can revoke AI authorization.

3. **Cyber 7.2 - Patching**: Consider requesting 45 days for critical patches if 30 is operationally difficult.

4. **AI 5.5 - AI Incident Definition**: "Inaccuracies in Deliverables" is broad - could trigger incident reporting for minor content errors. Consider requesting materiality threshold.
