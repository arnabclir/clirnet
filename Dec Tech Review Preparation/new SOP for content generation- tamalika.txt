Additionally, as discussed, I am sharing the SOP for content generation:
Steps	Detailed tasks
Step 1: Initiation of Content Generation	Provide the prompt to the automated content generator, specifying the exact topic
Step 2: Generation of Topic Variants	•	The module produces 7–9 variants of content, each with a different topic name derived from the requested subject
•	We review all the topics of generated variants
Step 3: Duplicate Check	Check for duplicates in:
•	The CRM portal using the main topic and relevant keywords
•	Internal data sheets (internal Excel sheets maintained by the team)
If similar contents were uploaded recently:
•	Review which research papers/guidelines were cited in those contents
•	If those sources already appear in recent uploads:
o	Determine whether new research articles, updated guidelines, new drug approvals, or other updated information are missing from recent contents

Verification of guideline updates:
•	Guideline Central
•	WHO, CDC, and other regulatory bodies
•	Specialty-specific guidelines such as:
•	ADA, GOLD, GINA, AAFP, FIGO, ESHIRE, etc.

If such missing or updated information is identified:
•	Consider selecting those updated topics for content generation
Step 4: Initiation of Content Generation Process	•	Submit the final selected topics for automated generation
•	Contents usually take 5–15 minutes to generate
•	Generated contents appear in the “Team → Pending” tab
Step 5: Identification and Assignment of Generated Content	•	Contents appear with system-generated IDs (not topic names)
•	For each content:
•	Click the “Action” button to view the actual topic name
•	Reassign the content to the appropriate team member
•	Once assigned, the designated team member sees the content in:
“My → Pending” tab as “Task for MedWiki Review”

Step 6: Content Editing, Fact Checking and Review Process	Categorization
•	Select the appropriate Category: Diagnosis, Management, or Case

Formatting Requirements
•	Ensure the topic name, all headers, and sub-headers are in sentence case
•	Maintain proper bullet format
•	Provide “:” after each subheaders
•	Maintain Upper case of each letters starting after “:”
•	Maintain spacing format after, before, and between certain symbols (e.g., <, >, ≥, etc.)

Scientific and Clinical Verification
•	Verify all information against cited research articles and authoritative guidelines
•	Alter or add information where necessary
•	Check new drug approval and dosage from FDA, CDSCO
•	Remove irrelevant or redundant content

 Reference and Citation Verification
Check whether the following criteria are fulfilled:
•	AMA citation style
•	Correct article titles, author names, and journal names
•	Proper and valid URLs
•	Correct sequence/numbering of citations
If needed:
•	Add missing references, ensuring accuracy and consistency

Keywords
•	Provide appropriate keywords for the final content

Specialization and Region Selection
•	Choose relevant medical specialties
•	Select country status (Global or Indian)
Step 7: Cover Image	Consider the automated image if scientifically relevant to the topic:
•	Disregard the previous guidelines set for the cover image
Step 8: Completion of Primary Review	•	Mark the task as Complete
•	Assign the content to a reviewer for final approval
Step 9: Final Review and Approval	•	Content appears in the reviewer’s “My → Pending” tab as “Task for MedWiki Approval”
•	Reviewer performs the final review and validates all edits
•	After final approval, the reviewer completes the task
Step 10: Final Output	Upon completion, a MedWiki ID is generated indicating the content is finalized and stored in the MedWiki database

Thanks,
