As per our last review, we have prepared a UI to help mitigate the time taken to search for content problem (~25 min per content title). The url is-> https://clir-dev-medwiki-gen-demo-574454500954.asia-south1.run.app/titles/ui

Semantic Search UI
Overview
The Semantic Search UI provides an intuitive interface for searching medical content available in the CLIRNET platform. It leverages advanced LLM-powered query expansion to find relevant medical articles, clinical guidelines, and educational content.
Access URL: /titles/ui
How It Helps
1. Intelligent Query Expansion
When you enter a search query, the system automatically generates multiple semantically related queries to maximize search coverage. For example:
Your query: "hypertension treatment guidelines"
Expanded queries generated:
•	hypertension treatment guidelines
•	hypertension management guidelines
•	HTN treatment protocols
•	guidelines for managing essential hypertension
•	clinical practice guidelines for blood pressure control
This ensures you don't miss relevant content due to terminology differences.
2. Comprehensive Results
The UI displays results in two organized sections:
Expanded Queries Section
•	Shows each generated query variant
•	Displays the number of results found per query
•	Expandable to view individual results for each query
•	Helps understand which query variations yielded the most results
Filtered Results Section
•	Deduplicated, curated results from all queries
•	Removes duplicate content that appeared in multiple query results
•	Presents the most relevant content first
3. Rich Content Preview
Each result card displays:
•	Question/Title: Clickable link to the full content on CLIRNET
•	Answer Preview: Truncated summary of the content
•	Date: Publication date for currency assessment
How to Use
1.	Navigate to the Semantic Search UI at /titles/ui
2.	Enter your search query in the text area
o	Use natural language (e.g., "diabetes management in elderly patients")
o	Or specific terms (e.g., "SGLT2 inhibitors cardiovascular outcomes")
3.	Click "Search" or press Ctrl+Enter
4.	Wait for results (typically 60-120 seconds due to LLM query expansion)
5.	Explore results:
o	Click "Expanded Queries" to see all query variations and their results
o	Click "Filtered Results" to see deduplicated top results
o	Click any result title to open the full content on CLIRNET

If this is helpful and works, we will figure out how to best integrate with the CMS Generator module. Please let us know in case of any issues.
