        "In this project, the extraction of the structured information of the web article with the help of DSPy and a LongCat OpenAI-compatible language model relies on an automated pipeline. The process starts with scraping of text based content of each of the URLs and breaking it into pieces that are easy to process. Each chunk is presented to the LLM, and the named entities are extracted and the semantic triples (source relation destination) are also produced. In order to provide consistency, the obtained results are verified, regularised, and added to the world list of mined elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "A list of deduplicated entities is then narrowed down to meaningful non-duplicated concepts by applying the deduplication logic of DSPy to all the chunks with its deduplication logic, after which all non-bafores are filtered out leaving only meaningful non-repetitive concepts. The triples are then filtered such that relationships between these ultimate deduplicated entities only are retained. The triples are cleaned automatically to produce Mermaid diagrams as follows: entities are the graph nodes of each node, and triples comprise a label connexion. In case there are no valid triples on a particular URL, then a fallback chain diagram is constructed, so that a valid Mermaid file is always created.\n",
        "\n",
        "At last, the tagged diagrams (mermaid_1.md to mermaid_10.md) and the tabular representation of all the entities (tags.csv) are saved and exported into a zip file to submit. This pipeline is fully automated and reproducible providing a way of transforming raw text into Knowledge graphs in a structured form."
